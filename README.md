## Introduction
This is the second milestone project of the fullstack software development course of Code Institute. I selected the memory card game assignment. My take on this game is to create a simple, engaging game that progresses in difficulty. Because it starts very simple, it is very intuitive and does not need instructions.

## UX
This project was designed with the mobile user in mind. The [wireframes](#) reflect this: mobile first and desktop second. Also, the code is written from the mobile perspective: the mobile viewport is the baseline. Media queries are used to add tablet and desktop viewports.

### User Stories
As a user I want to:

1. See an inviting game that makes me curious and want to play!
2. Understand what to do.
3. See my progress.

For kids in the Netherlands:
4. Understand the instructions in Dutch.

## Features
### Existing features

### Features left to implement
High score board: show all time statistics.
